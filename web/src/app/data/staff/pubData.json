    "kind": "Review",
    "description": "The era of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized our daily lives and AI has become a powerful force that is gradually transforming the field of medicine. Ophthalmology sits at the forefront of this transformation thanks to the effortless acquisition of an abundance of imaging modalities. There has been tremendous work in the field of AI for retinal diseases, with age-related macular degeneration being at the top of the most studied conditions. The purpose of the current systematic review was to identify and evaluate, in terms of strengths and limitations, the articles that apply AI to optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in order to predict the future evolution of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) during its natural history and after treatment in terms of OCT morphological structure and visual function. After a thorough search through seven databases up to 1 January 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 1800 records were identified. After screening, 48 articles were selected for full-text retrieval and 19 articles were finally included. From these 19 articles, 4 articles concentrated on predicting the anti-VEGF requirement in neovascular AMD (nAMD), 4 articles focused on predicting anti-VEGF efficacy in nAMD patients, 3 articles predicted the conversion from early or intermediate AMD (iAMD) to nAMD, 1 article predicted the conversion from iAMD to geographic atrophy (GA), 1 article predicted the conversion from iAMD to both nAMD and GA, 3 articles predicted the future growth of GA and 3 articles predicted the future outcome for visual acuity (VA) after anti-VEGF treatment in nAMD patients. Since using AI methods to predict future changes in AMD is only in its initial phase, a systematic review provides the opportunity of setting the context of previous work in this area and can present a starting point for future research.",

    "title": "The profile: unleashing your deepfake self",

    "kind": "Article",
    "description": "From the way we perceive society to the way we perceive ourselves, the virtual environment is changing the fundamental mechanisms of living. There is a significant gap in understanding the impact of current AI technologies on society. For instance, deepfake creates realistic forgeries that make people unable to distinguish reality from fiction, while filtering algorithms distort the perception by amplifying the interests of the user. The speed and scale of the virtual world and its hazy moral context put pressure on regulators to build the groundwork of ethical codes and regulatory frameworks. The multifaceted nature of such regulatory frameworks - legal, technological, societal, political, ethical - make it a challenging task, in which the public perception remains a key issue.The study presents a multimedia art installation - 'The Profile'- based on deepfake technologies, in which the users movements are gradually learned and an alter ego is generated. The user becomes confused when this alter ego starts to deviate from its initial mirroring behaviour. 'The Profile' artwork aims to raise awareness of the main threats of current online technologies and dark patterns employed online. The users experience ethical dilemmas regarding the impact of the latest technologies in a metaphoric approach. The interaction is structured in three parts that match the steps of creating an online identity: (i) filling personal data, (ii) agreeing to terms and conditions, and (iii) receiving personalised content. Our work extends the current state-of-the-art by using the decomposition of the frame along with the image simplification, real time rendering and the combination of ethics and art for human-centred technology. We also discuss some of the risks of AI, along with the proposal of art as a way to approach technology ethics. With the 'The Profile', we aim to raise awareness about the power of deepfakes, build new technology, understand human behaviour, and present a fresh perspective on intertwining art and AI.",

    "description": "In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, many were quick to spread deceptive information. I investigate here how reasoning in Description Logics (DLs) can detect inconsistencies between trusted medical sources and not trusted ones. The not-trusted information comes in natural language (e.g. 'Covid-19 affects only the elderly'). To automatically convert into DLs, I used the FRED converter. Reasoning in Description Logics is then performed with the Racer tool.",

    "year": 2015,
    "domain": "Software and Hardware Technologies for AI/Robotics for healthcare Rob Tech Med",
    "kind": "Paperwork",
    "description": "The acquisition of data through remote sensing has become of great importance in precision agriculture, as it covers large geographical areas faster and cheaper than ground inspections. The challenge is to develop technical solutions that can benefit from both huge amounts of raw data extracted from satellite images, but also from the robust amount of knowledge refined during centuries of agricultural practice. Aiming to accurately classify crops from satellite images, we developed a hybrid intelligent system that can exploit both agricultural expert knowledge and machine learning algorithms. As the crop raw data is characterized by heterogeneity, we drive our attention to ensemble learners, while expert knowledge is encapsulated within a rule-based system. Vote-based methods for solving conflicts between ensemble’s base learners have difficulties in classifying exceptional cases correctly and also to give the …",

    "kind": "Paperwork",
    "description": "We developed a plant monitoring system that uses machine learning to classify environment conditions as favorable or not for plant development. The decision is taken based on six features whose values are measured from sensors: light, temperature, vibrations, soil humidity, rain quantity and vertical distance. Aiming to assure transparency in the classification decision, we used a modified version of the version space algorithm. We adapted the version space algorithm to deal with situations when hypotheses do not agree on a single decision. As a result, 20% from the instances unclassified by the version space were classified by our enhanced version space algorithm. The developed tool is available online as an open-source project.",

    "year": 2016,
    "domain": "Intelligent and Autonomous Systems",
    "kind": "Article",
    "description": "Although the continuous safety technology advances in fields like air traffic control (ATC) systems or medical devices, the crux of safety assurance still comes down to human decision makers, which, within the context of having to define priorities while simultaneously considering different contextual criteria, present a constant high risk of erroneous decisions. We illustrate in this article a recommender framework for assisting flight controllers, which combines argumentation theory and model checking in the evaluation of trade-offs and compromises to be made in the presence of incomplete and potentially inconsistent information. We view a Hybrid Kripke model as a description of an ATC domain and we apply a rational decision strategy based on Hybrid Logics and Defeasible Reasoning to assist the process of model update when the system has to accommodate new properties or norm constraints. When the model fails to verify a property, a defeasible logic program is used to analyze the current state and perform updating operations on the model. The introduced decision making framework is tested on a recommender system in ATC and model update is demonstrated with respect to the verification and adaption of unmanned aerial vehicles routes in the air traffic space. The results show an important potential for the presented framework to be integrated directly into existing decision-making routines for achieving higher accuracy in recommender system methods.",

    "title": "Deep Clustering for Blood Cell Classification and Quantification",
    "year": 2024,
    "domain": "Medical Technologies",
    "kind": "Article",
    "description": "Accurate classification of blood cells plays a key role in improving automated blood analysis for both medical and veterinary applications. This work presents a two-stage deep clustering method for classifying blood cells from high-dimensional signal data. In the first stage, red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs) are separated using a combination of an improved autoencoder and the IDEC algorithm. The second stage further classifies RBC subtypes, pure RBCs, reticulocytes, and clumped RBCs, through a variational deep embedding (VaDE) approach. Due to the lack of detailed cell-level labels, soft classification probabilities are generated from sample-level data to approximate the true distributions. The aim is to contribute to the development of low-cost, automated blood analysis systems suitable for veterinary and biomedical use. Initial results indicate this method shows promise in effectively distinguishing different blood cell populations, even with limited supervision.",
